# ABS: Anti-BS pattern classifier

NumPy implementation of Thierry Denoeux's Evidence-Theoretic Classifier. Basically a generalization of radial basis function (RBF) networks utilizing Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. Unlike the original RBFNs, can detect novelty, uncertainty and discriminate between the two.
